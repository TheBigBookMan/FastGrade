# Data Models / ERD

These documents describe **feature-scoped data models**.

Rules:
- Do NOT generate a full ERD upfront
- Only document tables/entities touched by a feature
- This is descriptive, not prescriptive
- Schema changes must be explicitly approved

Diagrams (e.g. Mermaid) are added only when helpful.
