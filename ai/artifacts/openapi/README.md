# OpenAPI Specifications

These OpenAPI specs are **feature-scoped**.

Rules:
- Do NOT generate a full system OpenAPI upfront
- Each feature or endpoint gets its own spec file
- Specs reflect *tested behavior*, not assumptions
- Specs are updated after tests pass

When enough feature specs exist, they may be merged
into a shared system-level OpenAPI.
