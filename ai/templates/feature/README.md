## Purpose
This folder is the **working space for a single feature**.
It contains drafts, decisions, plans, and execution checklists that lead to
final updates in `/ai/artifacts`.

This folder:
- captures *why* decisions were made
- enables parallel agent work
- prevents churn in canonical artifacts
- serves as historical context after release

## Canonical Artifacts Impacted
- OpenAPI: yes / no
- Data Model (ERD): yes / no
- Architecture: yes / no
- Quality / Test Strategy: yes / no
- Ops / Release: yes / no

## Promotion Rules
- Files in this folder are **draft / working documents**
- Final system truth lives in `/ai/artifacts`
- Promotion to canonical artifacts happens **only after review & approval**
